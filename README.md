# android-build
Dockerized Android Build image.  Optional versions with the NDK installed.

## Architecture
These Android build images are dereived from the official [gradle](https://hub.docker.com/_/gradle) image.  We use the `gradle:8.2-jdk17` image in the latest build which includes JDK 17.  This gradle version is consistant with the version currently used by the latest version of Android Studio.  Older images use `gradle:7.4-jdk11` and `gradle:6.5-jdk8`.

The main software that is added to the non-NDK versions:
* Android SDK Tools - provides the `sdkmanager` command line tool
* Kotlin - installed via SDKMAN

The sdkmanager packages that are installed are generally the current version and the previous version.  Check the Dockerfile for more details.

## Examples
Run the following command in your Android project.  The directory should be same as your `build.gradle` file.
```
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/home/gradle/ smithmicro/android-build:34
```

The default command of this image is `gradle build`, but you can run others.

Run a gradle clean:
```
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/home/gradle/ smithmicro/android-build:34 gradle clean
```

Show installed sdkmanager packages:
```
docker run --rm smithmicro/android-build:34-ndk26 sdkmanager --list
```

## Build
To build all images containers in this repo, run:
```
./build.sh
```
